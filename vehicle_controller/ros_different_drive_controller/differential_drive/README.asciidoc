= differential-drive

This is the `differential_drive` ROS package written by Jon Stephan.
The originally published version of the package was released on
Google Code. When Google Code was archived, a copy was pulled into
GitHub.

The original package was written for ROS Groovy. In 2015 Mark Rose
made minor source changes to update the package for ROS Hydro and above,
moving to catkin, removing code warnings,
and changing the package layout to match current ROS guidelines.
